📢 **Note**: This project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial but significantly modified. I changed the entire color scheme, designed a custom company logo in Canva, adjusted the currency to **Ringgit (RM)**, sourced all necessary logos, and tailored the visualizations for better insights. This was part of my **Power BI learning journey**, where I gained hands-on experience in **data preprocessing, modeling, and dashboard design**.
